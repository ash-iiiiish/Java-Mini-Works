# Java Mini Works ☕

## 📌 Overview
**Java Mini Works** is a collection of mini projects developed using the **Java programming language**.
This repository demonstrates my understanding of **core Java concepts**, **object-oriented programming (OOP)**,
and practical problem-solving by building real-world applications.

Each project focuses on implementing Java fundamentals such as classes, objects, methods,
conditionals, loops, and data handling.
